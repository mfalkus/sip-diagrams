<hr />

This is a basic web app that lists some typical SIP flows, showing a call flow diagram
for each. Originally done as a project to get used to working with
[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/)
but it's potentially useful as a tool to learn a little SIP as well.

The code is rough and ready, you've been warned.

The project was bootstrapped via
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This means you
can clone the repo, `npm install` then `npm start` to run a local version.
