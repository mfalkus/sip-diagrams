# SIP Diagram Generator

A basic web app that lists some typical SIP flows, showing a call flow diagram
for each. Originally done as a project to get used to working with Mermaid,
but potentially useful as a tool to learn a little SIP as well.

The code is rough and ready, you've been warned.

The project was originally bootstrapped via
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This means you
can clone the repo, `npm install` then `npm start` to see your local version.
